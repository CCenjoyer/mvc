                <h2>Classes</h2>
                <h3>Card</h3>
                <p>Card is a very basic class. It has two attributes, suit and value. These attributes determine what specific card it is. If it
                has the suit of <em>"diamond"</em> and value of <em>11</em> its a diamond jack. Most of the methods contained within the class just play around with and use 
                these two attributes.</p>

                <h3>CardGraphic</h3>
                <p>CardGraphic inherits the class <em>Card</em> and can therefore use the same methods and attributes as an Object of the Card class can.
                    The point of this class is to give the user a utf-8 card symbol to represent the card contained within the regular card-attributes.
                </p>

                <h3>CardHand</h3>
                <p>
                CardHand can be simply be viewed as a list that can contain some Card object within it. It has two very basic methods for the moment, one to add a Card object to the hand
                and one to return a list of all the Card objects contained within the hand. 
                </p>


                <h3>DeckOfCards</h3>
                <p>
                In the same way as CardHand, DeckOfCards is really just a list made to contain Card objects, along with, of course, helpful methods. Such as creation of a brand new deck,
                drawing cards, shuffling and sorting the deck.
                </p>
